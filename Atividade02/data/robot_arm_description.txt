Description:
 	Data from a flexible robot arm. The arm is installed on an electrical 
 	motor.  We have modeled the transfer function from the measured reaction 
 	torque of the structure on the ground to the acceleration of the 
 	flexible arm.  The applied input is a periodic sine sweep.
 	
Sampling:
Number:
	1024
Inputs:
	u: reaction torque of the structure
Outputs:
	y: accelaration of the flexible arm
