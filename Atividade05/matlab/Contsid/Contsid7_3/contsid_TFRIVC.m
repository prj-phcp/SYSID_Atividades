%   Consider a continuous-time hybrid Box-Jenkins system with time-delay
%   given by:
% 
%      y(t) = [B(s)/F(s)]u(t-8) + [C(q)/D(q)]e(t)   
%	
% where
%	        B(s)            4
%	 G(s) = ---- =  -----------------

%	        C(q)            1 + 0.27q^(-1)

%   The excitation signal is chosen as a PRBS sequence.

    u = prbs(8,5);

%   The input and output are assumed to be uniformly sampled, i.e. the
%   sampling time Ts is constant.

    Ts = 0.1;

%   We then create a DATA object for the input signal with no output, 
%   the input u and sampling interval Ts. Additionally, the input
%   intersample behaviour is specified by setting the property
%   'Intersample' to 'zoh' since the input is piecewise constant here.

    datau = iddata([],u,Ts,'InterSample','zoh');

%   The noise-free output is simulated with the SIMC routine and stored in 
%   ydet. We then create a data object with output ydet, input u and 
%   sampling interval Ts.     

    ydet    = simc(MP0,datau);
    datadet = iddata(ydet,u,Ts,'Intersample','zoh');
 
%   Let us add colored noise to the noise-free response considering a 
%   signal-to-noise ratio of 15 dB. Afterwards we plot the data.

%   We plot the noise-free data (blue) and the data with noise (red) on a
%   zoomed part of the dataset. The presence of the time-delay is clearly 
%   noticeable since the system answers 8s after the first step at time 40s
%   is sent.

%   To reduce the estimation error covariance, we consider noise modeling.
%   This is can be done by calling the TFRIVC method. Assuming that the
%   noise is modeled as a (2,2) DT ARMA model, the TFRIVC is called by the
%   statement

    nd = length(D) - 1;
    nc = length(C) - 1;
    
    [MP2 MN] = tfrivc(data,np,nz,'NN',[nd,nc]);
