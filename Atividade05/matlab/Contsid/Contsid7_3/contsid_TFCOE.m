%   Consider a continuous-time SISO first order system with time delay
%   described by the following statement

    iodelay = 8;
    num     = 12;
    den     = [1 1];
    M0      = idtf(num,den,'InputDelay',iodelay)

    clc

%   The excitation signal is a PRBS sequence.

    u = prbs(12,1);

%   The input and output are assumed to be uniformly sampled, i.e. the
%   sampling time Ts is constant.

    Ts = 0.1;

%   We then create a DATA object for the input signal with no output, 
%   input u and sampling interval Ts. Additionally, the input intersample 
%   behaviour is specified by setting the property 'Intersample' to 'zoh' 
%   since the input is piecewise constant here. 

    datau = iddata([],u,Ts,'InterSample','zoh');

%   The noise-free output is simulated with the SIMC routine and stored in 
%   ydet. We then create a data object with output ydet, input u and 
%   sampling interval Ts. 

    ydet    = simc(M0,datau);
    datadet = iddata(ydet,u,Ts,'Intersample','zoh');
 
%   Let us add noise to the noise-free response considering a 
%   signal-to-noise ratio of 15 dB. Afterwards we plot the data.

    snr  = 15;
    y    = simc(M0,datau,snr);
    data = iddata(y,u,Ts,'Intersample','zoh');

%   We plot the noise-free data (blue) and the data with noise (red) on a
%   zoomed part of the dataset. The presence of the time-delay is clearly 
%   noticeable since the system answers 8s after the first step at time 40s
%   is sent.

%   We will identify a continuous-time model for this system from the data 
%   object with the TDCOE algorithm. The extra information required is
%   the number of numerator (B polynomial) and denominator (F polynomial)
%   parameters, i.e. np and nz.
% 
    nz = length(num) - 1;
    np = length(den) - 1;
    M  = tfcoe(data,np,nz)
    
%   The results are pretty good. Note that the iterative search is initiated 
%   (by default) by testing several time delay values in the time delay
%   range.

%   Estimation using a priori knowledge: 
%   If there is a guess about the time-delay we can specify it together 
%   with a lower and an upper bound. The true time-delay is Td = 8 and we
%   can call TDCOE considering: Td = 5. The time-delay boundaries TdMin
%   and TdMax remain the default values. 
%
%   Additionally we can specify lambda0, which is the breakpoint frequency 
%   in "rad/time unit" of the state variable filter. According to Chen et 
%   al., 2017, lambda0 should be a small value, typically 1/10 the system 
%   bandwidth

    td     = 5; 
    lambda = 0.1;
    M1     = tfcoe(data,np,nz,td,'Lambda',lambda)
    
%   The performance of the algorithm is typically unsatisfactory, as we can
%   see from the poor fit (large errors on the estimated parameters that
%   can also be observed when comparing the step responses.

%   Applying the 'OverPar' option:
