%   Consider a continuous-time SISO second order system with time-delay
%   described by the following statement

    iodelay = 8;
    num     = [-4 0.5];
    den     = [1 1 4];
    M0      = idtf(num,den,'IODelay',iodelay)

%   Let us have a look at the step response
    step(M0)
    title('Step response')
    
%   It can be observed from the step response that the system is non-minimum
%   phase, with a zero in the right half plane.

    bode(M0);
     
%   From the frequency response, we can see that the system has one resonant 
%   mode around 2 rad/sec and a DC-gain much smaller than 1 (0.125).

%   The excitation signal is chosen as a PRBS sequence.

    u = prbs(8,5);

%   The input and output are assumed to be uniformly sampled, i.e. the
%   sampling time Ts is constant.

    Ts = 0.1;

%   We then create a DATA object for the input signal with no output, 
%   the input u and sampling interval Ts. Additionally, the input
%   intersample behaviour is specified by setting the property
%   'Intersample' to 'zoh' since the input is piecewise constant here.

    datau = iddata([],u,Ts,'InterSample','zoh');

%   The noise-free output is simulated with the SIMC routine and stored in 
%   ydet. We then create a data object with output ydet, input u and 
%   sampling interval Ts.     

    ydet    = simc(M0,datau);
    datadet = iddata(ydet,u,Ts,'Intersample','zoh');
 
%   Let us add noise to the noise-free response considering a 
%   signal-to-noise ratio of 15 dB. Afterwards we plot the data.

    snr  = 15;
    y    = simc(M0,datau,snr);
    data = iddata(y,u,Ts,'Intersample','zoh');

%   We plot the noise-free data (blue) and the data with noise (red) on a
%   zoomed part of the dataset. The presence of the time-delay is clearly 
%   noticeable since the system answers 8s after the first step at time 40s
%   is sent.

%   We should be aware that identification of this system is challenging
%   since the loss function is multi-modal with respect to the time-delay.
%   To have a deeper understanding into this problem, let us show how the
%   loss function evolves with respect to the time-delay.

%   Below we fix the time-delay and using the SRIVC method to estimate the
%   model parameters. The loss function value is computed for each
%   time-delay value.

    i = length(tau);

    for i = length(tau) -1 : -1 : 1
        model.IODelay = tau(i);
        model = tfsrivc(data,model,'FixTd','on','MaxIter',1);

%   It can be tested that the convergence of time-delay cannot be
%   guaranteed if poor initial time-delay is provided. For example, when
%   initial time-delay is Td0 = 2,the model estimate may not converge to
%   the optimal one.

    Td0    = 2;
    lambda = 1;

%   This problem can be circumvented by exhaustive search, that is, to test
%   a set of possible time-delay values and see which is better. In the
%   Contsid toolbox the routine is TFSRIVC_INIT. 

%   By using TFSRIVC_INIT to generate an initial model, where the
%   'NumTd' property defines the number of time-delay values to be
%   tested.
